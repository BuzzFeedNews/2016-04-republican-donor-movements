## Data

The analyses depend entirely on data from the __Federal Election Commission__. The FEC provides bulk downloads of campaign finance data from [its website](http://fec.gov/portal/download.shtml); this analysis uses the `Candidate Master File` and the `Contributions by Individuals` from the 2015-16 cycle. The `Contributions by Individuals` file is too large to upload to GitHub. The version we used for our analysis is available [here](https://archive.org/details/fec-contributions-master-file-2016-04-25).

## Analyses

The full methodology and all code can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-04-republican-donor-movements/blob/master/notebooks/donor-movement-analysis.ipynb).
